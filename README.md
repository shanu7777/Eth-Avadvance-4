# Ethereum Account Abstraction Wallet DApp

This repository hosts a decentralized application (DApp) centered around Ethereum smart contract wallets, leveraging the concept of account abstraction. Built using Solidity, React, the DApp offers a streamlined interface for users to efficiently manage Ether and ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It emphasizes ease of use, security, and flexible wallet management through account abstraction techniques.

## Getting Started
